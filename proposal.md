## Research Question

Over the past two decades, climate change has become a topical issue that many worry about due to its implications on our planet and quality of life. One effect of increasing temperatures from climate change is the melting of the polar ice caps which leads to high amounts of fresh water flooding our oceans and the sea level gradually rising. With this sea level rise comes numerous problems, one of which is its impact on coastal cities or homes. As sea levels rise, they erode beaches, reduce usable land, and jeopardize the integrity of structures that were not built in accordance with much higher sea levels. The rising sea level is a major concern for many coastal home owners, and we plan to analyze this problem further. 


In this project, we want to analyze the correlation between the gobal change in sea level and the listing prices for U.S. houses in coastal regions in an
attempt to measure the relationship bewteen rising sea levels and coastal housing prices. Using our results we want to look at the difference in listing prices changes between the average U.S. home listing price and the coastal U.S. home listing prices to see how changes in sea levels effected the two groups. From the differences, we are hoping to be able to better explain how much changes in sea level are actually effecting the listing value of coastal homes. Finally, using all of our results from our analysis, we will attempt to predict how coastal property listing values will be effected given the estimated rise in U.S. coastal sea waters. Data on our estimated rise over the next 10 years is provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.





What do we want to know or what problems are we trying to solve? As in the midterm, you should list (1) the “bigger” question/debate/problem you’re interested in, and also (2) the specific research question(s) you’ll actually try to answer.

The research question will be smaller in scope than the big picture question. But the answer to your specific research question should shed light on the bigger question (although it likely won’t conclusively answer it).

The answer to your specific research question should shed light on the bigger question (although it likely won’t conclusively answer it).

If your project is about relationships, what are the hypotheses you’re testing?

If your project is about prediction, what is your metrics of success? (What are you maximizing?) Can you find a baseline from prior work to give you a ball park to aim for?

## Necessary Data
This section should cover:

What does the final dataset need to look like (mostly dictated by the question and the availability of data):

What is an observation, e.g. a firm, or a firm-year, etc.

What is the sample period?

What are the sample conditions? (Years, restrictions you anticipate (e.g. exclude or require some industries)

What variables are absolutely necessary and what would you like to have if possible?

What data do we have and what data do we need?

How will we collect more data?

What are the raw inputs and how will you store them (the folder structure(s) for each input type)?

Speculate at a high level (not specific code!) about how you’ll transform the raw data into the final form.
