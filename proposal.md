## Research Question

Over the past two decades, climate change has become a topical issue that many worry about due to its implications on our planet and quality of life. One effect of increasing temperatures from climate change is the melting of the polar ice caps which leads to high amounts of fresh water flooding our oceans and the sea level gradually rising. With this sea level rise comes numerous problems, one of which is its impact on coastal cities or homes. As sea levels rise, they erode beaches, reduce usable land, and jeopardize the integrity of structures that were not built in accordance with much higher sea levels. The rising sea level is a major concern for many coastal home owners, and we plan to analyze this problem further. 

In this project, we want to analyze the correlation between the gobal change in sea level and the listing prices for U.S. houses in coastal regions in an attempt to measure the relationship bewteen rising sea levels and coastal housing prices. Using our results we want to look at the difference in listing prices changes between the average U.S. home listing price and the coastal U.S. home listing prices to see how changes in sea levels affected the two groups. From the differences, we are hoping to be able to better explain how much changes in sea level are actually effecting the listing value of coastal homes. Finally, using all of our results from our analysis, we will attempt to predict how coastal property listing values will be effected given the estimated rise in U.S. coastal sea waters. Data on our estimated rise over the next 10 years is provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

To answer our question, we obtained from FRED the coastal U.S. housing listing monthly prices for the past 6 years (2017-2023) on numerous, prominent U.S. coastal cities as well as the overall average U.S. home listing price. Addtionally, from Kaggle we were able to locate data on global sea level rises over the past three decades (1991-2021). In this dataset, the primary variable we will be using for analysis is GMSL_noGIA (Global Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) not applied), which is the global mean sea level variation (mm) with respect to 20-year TOPEX/Jason collinear mean reference. Not accounting for GIA means that we will not be accounting for possible movements in the earth's crust under or around ice caps. Addtionally, the 20-year TOPEX/Jason collinear mean reference is a prominently used study that examines historic sea levels rises and predicts a trend of a rise of 3.3 mm/year in sea level. 

For our hypotheses, we predict that a rise in sea level has a statistically significant impact on the listing prices of homes in U.S. coastal cities. To explore this hypothesis, our null hypothesis is that the average change in coastal city home listing prices associated with a 1 mm rise in global sea levels is equal to 0, or β1 = 0, with all other variables held constant. Our alternative hypothesis therefore tests if this association is not equal to one, or β1 ≠ 0, and if any correlation is present between these variables. 


## Necessary Data

As explained above, we currently have two types of data set to merge for further investigation and analysis. Sourced from FRED, the first dataset is the average monthly house listing price in select coastal cities (Miami, New York, New Orleans, Hawaii, and Myrtle). Listing data for Colorado city (non-coastal) and national data is also included as a benchmark for our comparison and analysis. This data set is currently sampled for the period 2017-2023. With sample data from Kaggle, the second dataset is the change in sea level as observed by satellites. This dataset includes 9 variables and 1048 observations for the period 1993 – 2021. Some variables of interest are GMSL (Global Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) not applied) variation (mm) with respect to 20-year TOPEX/Jason collinear mean reference, Smoothed (60-day Gaussian type filter) GMSL (GIA not applied) variation (mm). We will also examine whether GIA applied will have any effect on our analysis. The original measurements are taken from NASA satellites, which we intend to look further into for more updated data. After merging these two types of dataset, our final data set will have an observation of a city-month. Necessary variables are date-time, the average housing prices for select coastal cities, the month-over-month percentage change in price, and sea level data (both raw and smoothed). 

Considerations for further data collection include expanding and refining our criteria for selecting more coastal cities to represent different US coastal regions (e.g. Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Gulf of Mexico). We project that the correlation might look different due to the regional differences in both sea level and housing price changes. We will also collect more historical housing price data to match the observation period of the sea level data that we have (1993-2021) and conduct the analysis on decade changes.

Our final data set may look like this:

| NY | Jan | 1993 | $ | % |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Currently, we plan to analyze the average monthly listing price of houses in a given city for a grouping of coastal cities that we’ve selected and compare that to the average national listing price of a house. We will also include a random sampling of cities that are not located on the coast to help us determine if there is a significant relationship between housing prices and sea level. The data that we’ve currently included in our inputs folder will serve as a placeholder until we develop a comprehensive and thorough criteria that defines what we will consider to be a coastal city for this analysis. To organize our data, we will create three different subfolders within our inputs folder to help us compartmentalize our analysis. The first folder will contain only information pertaining to the prices of homes in coastal cities and will also contain a file outlining our criteria for what our definition of a coastal city is. The second subfolder will be our control group and will house all of our data for both our random sampling of house prices in non coastal cities and the national averages. Lastly, our third subfolder will contain all of the data we’ve collected with regard to sea level rise. We believe that organizing our folders in such a manner will not only make our repository easier for us to use, but will also help future visitors better understand and interact with our work.

Transforming our data into its final form will likely not be a difficult task for our group due to a multitude of reasons. While our analysis of the potential correlations we discover will be complex, the data itself that we will be sourcing is quite simple in nature and is also well organized from common sources. For example, all our data with regard to housing prices comes from FRED which only includes the date and average listing prices meaning that our data should be easy to clean and manipulate as needed. The data from NASA/Kaggle concerning sea level rise is also quite simple and we will only need to utilize a small portion of the data available. However, one issue that we will likely encounter will be determining what timeline to utilize for our analysis as our housing data and sea level data have different units of measurement for time. Thus, the biggest issue for us will likely be removing unnecessary data and then cleaning the remaining data so that we can merge the necessary data together on a timeline that will provide fruitful results for our analysis. To accomplish this we will likely have to further examine and transform our data about sea levels in some way so that we may achieve a consistent and useful timeline for our analysis (likely on a scale of month(s)).
